## Python Codes

Check out the entired python code of [income](https://github.com/tuzunneslihan/WazeProject/blob/master/SF%20Salaries%20.ipynb) and [commute choice](https://github.com/tuzunneslihan/WazeProject/blob/master/SF%20TravelDesicionSurvey%20.ipynb) for this project.

## Project Summary

In this project, I'm trying to build machine learning models based on Kaggle and SMFTA's data: I came up with WAZE Rider San Francisco Pilot to study features of a carpool modelling and make prdedictions that could help the business.
Waze is going the corporate route. Its Silicon Valley pilot is starting with more than 25,000 employees of select companies that schlep workers from city and the South Bay. 

Kaggle Data - 
SFMTA Data

Commute choice: dataset about carpool desicions, e.g., drive alone, car share, shuttle, uber, public transportation
Location: information about users location
Income: total income
